This version of the "Pong spec" has been implemented in [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).


## Notes

This implementation acts as a control by which the others should be judged. This is due to the programmer implementing it having extensive Javascript experience.
