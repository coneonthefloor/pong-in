This version of the "Pong spec" has been implemented in [Javascript](https://www.java.com/en/) using the [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html).


## Notes

Java is at a disadvantage here due to it's verbosity. This implementation is also using Swing, which is not a game library. Which again is a disadvantage.

Despite this I found it quite easy to use the Java language. The syntax is incredibly clear and understandable. Swing on the other hand was not as clear.
It took me abotu an hour to get my head around JFrames and JPanels. Once I got these working there was no further issues.

I used [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) to code this implementation. So it felt like an old school coding experience. The IDE is a bit clunky.

I look forward to implementing a Java alternative using a game library and a better IDE, as I think the language itself is nice to use.
