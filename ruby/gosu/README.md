This version of the "Pong spec" has been implemented in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) using [Gosu](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/tree/master).

## Notes

What did I just write? Why does it work? I don't know. I often hear Ruby described as a magic language. Whilst writing this implementation I felt at many times that the code should break. But it always ran. I found this weird as I was sure there would be some syntax errors.

I can see from this short example why Ruby is often used at coding bootcamps. The syntax is interesting and visually appealing. With just a little practice it would be very easy to write readable Ruby code. I installer the language via the Ruby Installer on windows, and adde gosu as a gem. This process was quite simple and only took about 30 minutes.

Gosu as a game library doesn't seem to offer a great deal. I used very little from the library. Just a method to render a rect and some text.
